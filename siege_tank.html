<p><strong>Siege Tank Counter as Terran</strong></p>
<p>
    In TvT then Ravens are generally effective as they can disable the opponents Tanks and then to place your Tanks in sieging range.<br>
    The only thing you have to remember is to keep air control or else the opponents Vikings can zone out your Ravens. That being said,<br>
    Banshees in combination with a drop in their main or other diversionary tactics can be very effective in taking out your opponents Siege Tanks.<br>
    Also, if you have cloak then forcing out scans is very nice as it means fewer Mules for the other player. Dropping units on-top of the Tanks<br>
    can also work sometimes.

    In ZvT Muta-Ling-Bane can sometimes work because it forces the supporting Bio to kite backwards leaving the tanks exposed,<br>
    Zergling flanks during battles can also be very effective, Brood Lords are also very effective against both Bio and Siege Tanks.<br>
    Ultralisks are also decently good against Siege Tanks. If it is more of a Mech style the Infestor with Neural Parasite can work,<br>
    especially on Thors. Brood Lords can also be effective if they don't have a sufficient number of Hellbats

    Chargelots and Immortals do very well against Siege Tanks, but you have to include some sort of splash damage such as Colossi or High Templar,<br>
    otherwise your Zealots and Immortals will get killed too quick because their Bio can just kite backwards against Zealots and Immortals without splash support.<br>
    Dark Templar can also be nice to pick off a few Siege Tanks before they have time to react with a scan or Detection gets there.<br>
    You can also send Dark Templar in during the battle and the Terran player might not notice, Chargelot flanks are also usually good.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
<p>
    Siege Tanks are mostly about brute force so other than Ultralisks, I suggest not fighting directly with Siege Tank other than doing flanks etc.<br>
    Mobile armies and multi pronged attacks are very effective in my experience since Siege Tanks are very slow at moving and getting in position.
