        <h4>Siege Tank Counter as Terran</h4>

        <p>
            In TvT then Ravens are generally effective as they can disable the opponents Tanks and then to place your own Tanks in sieging range.
            The only thing you have to remember is to keep air control or else the opponents Vikings can zone out your Ravens. That being said,
            Banshees in combination with a drop in their main or other diversionary tactics can also be very effective in taking out your opponents Siege Tanks.
            Also, if you have Cloak then forcing out Scans is very nice as it means fewer Mules for the other player. Dropping units on-top of the Tanks
            can also work sometimes.

        <h4>Siege Tank Counter as Zerg</h4>

        <p>
            In ZvT Muta-Ling-Bane can sometimes work because it forces the supporting Bio to kite backwards leaving the tanks exposed,
            Zergling flanks during battles can also be very effective, Brood Lords are also very effective against both Bio and Siege Tanks.
            Ultralisks are also decently good against Siege Tanks. If it is more of a Mech style the Infestor with Neural Parasite can work,
            especially on Thors. Brood Lords can also be effective if they don't have a sufficient number of Hellbats

        <h4>Siege Tank Counter as Protoss</h4>

        <p>
            Chargelots and Immortals do very well against Siege Tanks, but you have to include some sort of splash damage such as Colossi or High Templar,
            otherwise your Zealots and Immortals will get killed too quick because their Bio can just kite backwards against
            Zealots and Immortals without splash support.
            Dark Templar can also be nice to pick off a few Siege Tanks before they have time to react with a scan or Detection gets there.
            You can also send Dark Templar in during the battle and the Terran player might not notice, Chargelot flanks are also usually good.

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>

        <p>
            Siege Tanks are mostly about brute force so other than Ultralisks, I suggest not fighting directly with Siege Tank other than doing flanks etc.
            Mobile armies and multi pronged attacks are very effective in my experience since Siege Tanks are very slow at moving and getting in position.
