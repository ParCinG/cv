        I decided to make my own Legacy of the Void counter sheet because I didn't
        find one I liked. The Zerg sheet isn't done yet though.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p>
        There are certain units that are particularly tough such as the Siege Tank.
        I have links to full articles on counters for them.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that there are two types of counters: "hard counters" and "soft counters".
        A <strong>hard counter</strong> means that the unit is completely dominant over
        another unit. A <strong>soft counter</strong> describes when a unit is against
        another unit but not overly so.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hard counter example: The Immortal is a hard counter to the Roach. Four Immortals
        can easily defeat 16 Roaches.
    </p>

    <p>
        Soft counter example: The Marauder is a soft counter to the Stalker. Marauders
        will beat Stalkers in a 1v1 combat, but 10 Stalkers will easily defeat 6 Marauders.</p>

    <p>
        Note: I'll be listing a unit with hard or soft after it.
    </p>

    <p>Note: I'll be listing Zealots as either Zealots, meaning without Charge. Or as Chargelots,
        meaning with Charge. Except with the Protoss list, I'll be listing them as Zealots either
        way, and I'll leave it to your discretion whether the counters are different if they have
        Charge or not.
    </p>

    <h3>Counters by Race</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="terran_sheet.html">Terran Counters</a></li>
        <li><a href="zerg_sheet.html">Zerg Counters</a></li>
        <li><a href="protoss_sheet.html">Protoss Counters</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note: I have not included every single unit counter, just the ones you will want to use. For<br>
        example, any ranged armored unit counters the Reaper, but most players use Reapers to rush, so<br>
        adding in Immortal would be sort of pointless. Immortals do counter the Reaper, but Terran players<br>
        are not using Reapers in any significant number by the time you get any Immortals on the field.
    </p>

    <p>As an example of this, for Protoss I mentioned Adepts(but you should probably do Stalkers<br>
        instead because Reapers out range Adepts, so some Terrans like to dance with their Reaper,<br>
        like me ðŸ˜€) rather than the Immortal. Immortals do counter Reapers, but you would usually<br>
        not build Immortals for the sole purpose of warding off Reapers when you could be using<br>
        the Adept or the Stalker.
    </p>

    <h3>Counters by Unit</h3>
    <p>However, not every unit has nice counters that you can put into charts. Let's look at the Siege Tank. Technically,<br>
        this unit is countered by pretty much any air unit, since it can only attack ground units. For example,<br>
        the Mutalisk could be considered a "hard counter" to the Siege Tank.
    </p>

    <p>In practice, this does not work like that. Most players won't build just one unit, and they will nearly<br>
        always have much more a composition of units that complement each other. Therefore, if they have<br>
        Siege Tanks they will nearly always have something like Thors with it so since Thors are a<br>
        hard counter to Mutalisks. Thors + Siege Tanks still do well against Mutalisks.
    </p>

    <p>Additionally, some counters are situation dependant. For example, the Colossus can be both strong<br>
        and weak against Zerglings, depending on the number and supporting units. One Colossus caught in<br>
        the open field can be quickly taken down by 12 Zerglings.<br>
    </p>

    <p>Despite this, the Colossus is still generally considered a counter to the Zergling, because<br>
        players nearly never get only one Colossus, and they never use Colossi without other units as<br>
        support. The Colossus becomes much better against the Zergling with Sentry support, as Force<br>
        Fields can prevent the Zerglings getting too close. Additionally, since Colossi deal splash<br>
        damage from a long range, adding more Colossi allows the protoss player to take out many<br>
        more Zerglings before the Zerglings get in attacking range. The end result is that in larger<br>
        numbers and with support the Colossus goes from being weak against Zerglings to countering them.
    </p>

    <p>As a result, I suggest focusing on building more balanced armies and strong unit combinations,<br>
        trying to just generally counter your opponent's army. And only using specific counters when<br>
        they are just massing one or two unit types. Also, Counters are only a small part of Starcraft 2<br>
        and there are a lot of other aspects to work on in Starcraft 2 and learning the counters for<br>
        your race is a good idea but the majority of players know them so knowing the counters just puts<br>
        you on even footing.
