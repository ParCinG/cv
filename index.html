<h3>I decided to make my own Legacy of the Void counter sheet because I didn't<br>
    find one I liked. It isn't finished yet but the terran sheet is partly done.</h3>
<hr>
<p>There are certain units that are particularly tough such as the Siege Tank. I have links to full articles on counters for them.</p>

<p>Note that there are two types of counters: "hard counters" and<br>"soft counters". A <strong>hard counter</strong> means that the unit is completely<br>
    dominant over another unit. A <strong>soft counter</strong> describes when a unit<br>is effective against another unit but not overly so.</p>

<p>Hard counter example: The Immortal is a hard counter to the Roach.<br>Four Immortals can easily defeat 16 Roaches.</p>

<p>Soft counter example: The Marauder is a soft counter to the<br>
    Stalker. Marauders will beat Stalkers in a 1v1 combat,<br>
    but 10 Stalkers will easily defeat 6 Marauders.</p>

<p>I'll be listing a unit with hard or soft after it.</p>
<h3>Counters by Race</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="terran_sheet.html">Terran Counters</a></li>
    <li><a href="zerg_sheet.html">Zerg Counters</a></li>
    <li><a href="protoss_sheet.html">Protoss Counters</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: I have not included every single unit counter, just the ones you will want to use. For<br>
    example, any ranged armored unit counters the Reaper, but most players use Reapers to rush, so<br>
    adding in Immortal would be sort of pointless. Immortals do counter the Reaper, but Terran players<br>
    are not using Reapers in any significant number by the time you get any Immortals on the field.</p>

<p>As an example of this, for Protoss I mentioned Adepts rather than the Immortal. Immortals<br>
    do counter Reapers, but you would usually not build Immortals for the sole purpose of<br>
    warding off Reapers when you could be using the Adept or the Stalker.</p>

<h3>Counters by Unit</h3>
<p>However, not every unit has nice counters that you can put into charts. Let's look at the Siege Tank. Technically,<br>
    this unit is countered by pretty much any air unit, since it can only attack ground units. For example,<br>
    the Mutalisk could be considered a "hard counter" to the Siege Tank.</p>

<p>In practice, this does not work like that. Most players won't build just one unit, and they will nearly<br>
    always have much more a composition of units that complement each other. Therefore, if they have<br>
    Siege Tanks they will nearly always have something like Thors with it so since Thors are a<br>
    hard counter to Mutalisks. Thors + Siege Tanks still do well against Mutalisks.</p>

<p>Additionally, some counters are situation dependant. For example, the Colossus can be both strong<br>
    and weak against Zerglings, depending on the number and supporting units. One Colossus caught in<br>
    the open field can be quickly taken down by 12 Zerglings.<br></p>

<p>Despite this, the Colossus is still generally considered a counter to the Zergling, because<br>
    players nearly never get only one Colossus, and they never use Colossi without other units as<br>
    support. The Colossus becomes much better against the Zergling with Sentry support, as Force<br>
    Fields can prevent the Zerglings getting too close. Additionally, since Colossi deal splash<br>
    damage from a long range, adding more Colossi allows the protoss player to take out many<br>
    more Zerglings before the Zerglings get in attacking range. The end result is that in larger<br>
    numbers and with support the Colossus goes from being weak against Zerglings to countering them.</p>

<p>As a result, I suggest focusing on building more balanced armies and<br>
    strong unit combinations, trying to just generally counter your opponents<br>
    army. And only using specific counters when they are just massing one<br>
    or two unit types. Also Counters are only a small part of Starcraft 2<br>
    and there are a lot of other aspects to work on in Starcraft 2 and<br>
    learning the counters for your race is a good idea but the majority<br>
    of players know them so knowing the counters just puts you on even<br>
    footing.</p>
