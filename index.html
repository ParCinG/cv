            I decided to make my own Legacy of the Void counter sheet because I didn't
            find one I liked. The Zerg sheet isn't done yet though.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are certain units that are particularly tough such as the Siege Tank.
            I have links to full articles on counters for them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that there are two types of counters: "hard counters" and "soft counters".
            A <strong>hard</strong> <strong>counter</strong> means that the unit is completely dominant over
            another unit. A <strong>soft</strong> <strong>counter</strong> describes when a unit is against
            another unit but not overly so.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hard counter example: The Immortal is a hard counter to the Roach. Four Immortals
            can easily defeat 16 Roaches.
        </p>

        <p>
            Soft counter example: The Marauder is a soft counter to the Stalker. Marauders
            will beat Stalkers in a 1v1 combat, but 10 Stalkers will easily defeat 6 Marauders.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note: I'll be listing a unit with hard or soft after it.
        </p>

        <p>Note: I'll be listing Zealots as either Zealots, meaning without Charge. Or as Chargelots,
            meaning with Charge. Except with the Protoss list, I'll be listing them as Zealots either
            way, and I'll leave it to your discretion whether the counters are different if they have
            Charge or not.
        </p>

        <h3>Counters by Race</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="terran_sheet.html">Terran Counters</a></li>
            <li><a href="zerg_sheet.html">Zerg Counters</a></li>
            <li><a href="protoss_sheet.html">Protoss Counters</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Note: Counters may change as a match goes on and units are upgraded and research is unlocked.
            For example, in the early game, a very well-microed Stalker can take down 5+ Marines due to the
            fact that a Stalker is faster than the Marines and the Stalker can out-range the Marines. Meanwhile,
            once Combat Shields, Medivacs, and Stimpack comes out, the Stalker no longer counters Marines.</p>


        <p>
            Note: I have not included every single unit counter, just the ones you might want to use. For
            example, any ranged armored unit counters the Reaper, but most players use Reapers to rush, so
            adding in Immortals would be sort of pointless. Immortals do counter the Reaper, but Terran players
            are not using Reapers in any significant number by the time you get any Immortals on the field.
        </p>

        <p>
            As an example of this, for Protoss I mentioned Adepts(but you should probably do Stalkers
            instead because Reapers out range Adepts, so some Terrans like to dance with their Reaper)
            rather than the Immortal. Immortals do counter Reapers, but you would usually
            not build Immortals for the sole purpose of warding off Reapers when you could be using
            the Adept or the Stalker.
        </p>

        <h3>Counters by Unit</h3>

        <p>
            However, not every unit has nice counters that you can put into charts. Let's look at the Siege Tank. Technically,
            this unit is countered by pretty much any air unit, since it can only attack ground units. For example,
            the Mutalisk could be considered a "hard counter" to the Siege Tank.
        </p>

        <p>
            In practice, this does not work like that. Most players won't build just one unit, and they will nearly
            always have much more a composition of units that complement each other. Therefore, if they have
            Siege Tanks they will nearly always have something like Thors with it so since Thors are a
            hard counter to Mutalisks. Thors + Siege Tanks still do well against Mutalisks.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, some counters are situation dependant. For example, the Colossus can be both strong
            and weak against Zerglings, depending on the number and supporting units. One Colossus caught in
            the open field can be quickly taken down by 12 Zerglings.
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite this, the Colossus is still generally considered a counter to the Zergling, because
            players almost never get only one Colossus, and they never use Colossi without other units as
            support. The Colossus becomes much better against the Zergling with Sentry support, as Force
            Fields can prevent the Zerglings getting too close. Additionally, since Colossi deal splash
            damage from a long range, adding more Colossi allows the protoss player to take out many
            more Zerglings before the Zerglings get in attacking range. The end result is that in larger
            numbers and with support the Colossus goes from being weak against Zerglings to countering them.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a result, I suggest focusing on building more balanced armies and strong unit combinations,
            trying to just generally counter your opponent's army, and only using specific counters when
            they are just massing one or two unit types. Also, counters are only a small part of Starcraft 2
            and there are a lot of other aspects to work on in Starcraft 2, and learning the counters for
            your race is a good idea but the majority of players know them so knowing the counters just puts
            you on even footing.
