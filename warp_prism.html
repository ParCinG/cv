        <p><strong>Warp Prism Counter as Terran</strong></p>
        <p>
            Warp Prisms are generally weak against Vikings, and Marines and Turrets can also be good at warding off Warp Prisms, and you should try
            not to leave your Siege Tanks exposed as they can drop inexpensive units on-top of your Siege Tanks causing splash damage to be dealt
            on your other Siege Tanks.

            Something to remember is this; players play to their strengths, and are creatures of habit. What that means in practice, is that once
            someone drops you, expect more. If a Protoss warps in to your main...expect them to do it again. If a Terran drops your main...
            expect them to do it again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once they show it to you, it's a good idea to preposition some units. 3-4 hydras or whatever units you have put on patrol is an optimal
            counter. It's enough to crush single transports without impacting the strength of your main army very significantly.

        <p>
            You can also use a reverse Uno card, start a Nydus in their main loaded with supply, and they won't have time to drop yours.

            Also, if you have spotter Overlords around your bases or Zerglings patrolling the edges of the map it will be much easier to
            spot drops in advance, henceforth not needing to set up a couple of units patrolling around all your bases.

        <p>
            If you are using a Stargate build you can build a few Phoenixes and patrol them around the edges of the map, and it will
            protect from most drops or warp-ins. You could also put a Cannon or a Battery in your mineral lines which buy time for
            a few Stalkers to come and clean it up, or for another warp-in of your own.
